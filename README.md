Octopus (oc)
===================

## Octopress Site Management, Simplified.
Octopus is a jetpack for your Octopress site. With a powerful set of commands that provide an array of site management features, you should be able to focus on your content... instead of on shell commands.

## Status
Octopus is stable, in active development, and in open testing (dogfooding on my own site [Sweetmeat](http://sweetme.at)).
