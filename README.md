Octopus (oc) | The Octopress Commander
===================

## Octopress Site Management, Simplified.
Octopus is a jetpack for your Octopress site. With a powerful set of commands that provide an array of site management features, you should be able to focus on your content... instead of on shell commands.

## Status
Octopus is stable and in open testing (including my own site [Sweetmeat](http://sweetme.at)). [Documentation](http://chrissimpkins.github.io/octopus) is in development.
